I am a seasoned developer known for my proficiency in crafting diverse applications, ranging from small-scale utilities to comprehensive managerial systems tailored to meet the specific requisites of administrators and managers. My expertise encompasses a spectrum of technologies including **C, C++, Python, REACT, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.**

My current focus revolves around an ongoing **MERN Stack Project**, wherein I am actively engaged in studying advanced JavaScript frameworks. Concurrently, I am deeply involved in enhancing my knowledge in C programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms. My enthusiasm lies in problem-solving, and I am passionate about leveraging my skills to overcome complex challenges.

In **computer vision**, my primary research centers on burst image restoration. I specialize in refining algorithms to enhance sequences of rapidly captured images, overcoming challenges like noise and blur. By leveraging advanced techniques, I aim to create superior-quality single images from bursts, with potential applications spanning consumer photography to critical fields like medical imaging and surveillance. My focus lies in pushing the boundaries of image reconstruction, contributing to robust algorithms at the intersection of computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning.

Furthermore, I have experience in teaching and helping fellow mates. I have supervised teams in the university as a teacher assistant welcomed new students with open arms and aided them to adapt to the university's workflow.
